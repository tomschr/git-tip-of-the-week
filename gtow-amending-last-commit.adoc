Amending the Last Commit
========================

Problem
-------

You've committed one or more files and you realize, you've forgot to
add or remove another file to the same commit.


Solution
--------

Git knows the `--amend` option for the commit subcommand. Let's assume, we
would like to add another file to the same(!) commit. Do the following:

1. Add the file as usual to your staging area:
+
   $ git add MISSING_FILE

2. Run git again with the `--amend` option:
+
   $ git commit --amend

3. Enter your commit message. You will see the last commit message that
   you have used. In most cases you can just it as it is. Of course, it
   is also possible to change your commit message if you don't like it.

4. Close your editor to send the commit to your Git repository.

The same applies when you need to remove a file (use `git rm` or just
`rm` instead of `git add`).

WARNING: Don't amend public commits!
