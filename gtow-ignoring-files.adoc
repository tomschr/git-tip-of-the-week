Ignoring Files

Problem
-------

You need to know how to ignore files regardless of your working
directory.


Solution
--------

Git knows three configuration files which you can use to ignore files:

1. `.gitignore`
+
Usually this file is the right place if you need to exclude stuff inside
your current repository which is relevant for _everyone_.

2. `.git/info/exclude`
+
This file is needed if you need to ignore some files locally in
your current repository; this file is only relevant for _you_ and
for nobody else.

3. `~/.gitignore`
+
Similar to `.git/info/exclude`, but applies to _all_ repositories
on your machine. To set this globally, use the following command:
+
    $ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
    $ vim ~/.gitignore
